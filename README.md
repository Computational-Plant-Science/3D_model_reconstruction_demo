# 3D root model reconstruction

The software package was integrated as a module at PlantIT website at : https://portnoy.cyverse.org/.
(Collaborate with Cyverse https://www.cyverse.org/ ) . Users are welcomed to registered as an user to try this package via PlantIT website. 

The software package was also available at Dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/r/computationalplantscience/3d-model-reconstruction) for advanced users to run locally via singularity at Linux environment: 

This software can be run by docker container, users do not need to install many libraries and compile complex source files. 
 
# Setup Docker container

OS requirements

    To install Docker container (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/): 

    To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:

    Ubuntu Groovy 20.10
    Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
    Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)
    Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 (LTS)

    Docker Engine is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, and arm64 architectures.

    Uninstall old versions
    $ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

    Set up the repository

    Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

    $ sudo apt-get update

    $ sudo apt-get install \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg-agent \
        software-properties-common

    Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:

    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

    Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88, by searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint.

    $ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

    pub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]
          9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid           [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]

    $ sudo add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
       $(lsb_release -cs) \
       stable"

    Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd, or go to the next step to install a specific version:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

    Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

    $ sudo docker run hello-world
    
# Run this container by building it locally:

    # Clone source code to your local path
    $ git clone https://github.com/Computational-Plant-Science/3D_model_reconstruction_demo.git
   
    # Enter into the source code folder named as "cd 3D_model_reconstruction_demo"
    $ cd 3D_model_reconstruction_demo/
   
    # Build docker container locally named as "3d_model_reconstruction" using "Dockerfile" in the same folder, note: docker repository name must be lowercase.
    $ docker build -t 3d_model_reconstruction -f Dockerfile .
   
    # Run the docker container by linking docker container data path to user's image data folder local path
    # Note: please replace $path_to_image_folder as your local image data folder path, 
    # Suggest to check your image folder path using "pwd" command
    # Example: $ docker run -v /home/suxing/example/root_images:/images -it 3d_model_reconstruction
   
    $ docker run -v /$path_to_image_folder:/images -it 3d_model_reconstruction
   
    # After launch the docker container, run "pipeline.sh" or "pipeline.sh" insider the container
    $ root@0529cde0b988:/opt/code# ./pipeline.sh
    or $ root@0529cde0b988:/opt/code# python3 pipeline.py

    # Get 3d model result named as "dense.0.ply"
    # After the container was executed successfully with image data files, user should be able to see output in your command window like this:
    '''
    Loading option-0000.ply, 48656 vertices ...
    Save to /images/dense.nvm ... done
    Save /images/dense.0.ply ...done
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    '''
    The 3D model file was in ply format(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)), it is located inside your image folder, its name is "dense.0.ply".
    path = "/$path_to_image_folder/dense.0.ply"
    
    To visualize the 3d model file, suggest to install Meshlab(https://www.meshlab.net/) or cloudcompare(https://www.danielgm.net/cc/)

   Docker container was maintained by Wesley Paul Bonelli. it was deployed to Plant IT website by Wesley Paul Bonelli (wbonelli@uga.edu).

   Singularity container overlay issues were solved by [Saravanaraj Ayyampalayam] (https://github.com/raj76) (mailto:raj76@uga.edu)

   Special thanks to Chris Cotter building the container recipe for testing and debugging.
